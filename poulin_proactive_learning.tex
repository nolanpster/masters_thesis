	% FIRST OF ALL:
% If you are using X-based Emacs to read this file, please switch on
% Syntax Highlighting by typing:
%    ALT-X  font-lock-mode   (or META-X on X-Terminals)
%
% That should make these comments nice and red so they can be easily
% distinguished from the actual code.
% =======================================================================

% This is a template for  Masters' Theses at WPI.
% It complies (more or less) to the standards given by the Library
% (as of February 1999)
%
% Feel free to use this file, but I give no guarantee for its compliance
% to standards (meaning I won't pay for the paper if the library rejects it :))
%
%
% The lengths (textheight, width etc.) are fine-tuned for ps1, ps2, and ps3,
% but seem to be somewhat dependent on the machine you are using to compile,
% the date, time, moon phase, the weather, and other quantum effects.
% You may have to change \oddsidemargin a little, but it's about 98% correct.
%
% Also, the spacing is correct (doublespacing with footnotes correctly
% singlespaced). Curiously, the font size is not specified in the
% regulations. So feel free to change it, but the majority of theses
% that I have seen is written in 12 point font.
%
% As for the inclusion of graphics, I recommend the methods specified
% in ``latexguide.ps'' off the CS-GSO Website. You can use other
% methods including copy and paste with a photocopier, but I think
% using the graphicx package is the easiest.
%
% Have fun and good luck with the thesis.

% This is the command for doublespacing when you use the setspace
% package
% Please do NOT use \baselinestretch, this will mess up everything,
% cause earthquakes, tornados and lots of questions for me...
% If you need a singlespaced paragraph (BAD STYLE!!!), use
% \singlespacing or \onehalfspacing and enclose it together with the
% paragraph in braces {\singlespacing This is my text... blah blah blah}
%
\doublespacing

% Now you can start to be creative.
% First, you need an abstract.
% Fortunately, LaTeX has thought of that, so it's very easy:
%
\begin{abstract}
    In multi-agent Markov Decision Processes, a controllable agent must perform optimal planning in a dynamic and
    uncertain environment that includes another unknown and uncontrollable agent.  Given a task specification for the
    controllable agent, its ability to complete the task can be impeded by an inaccurate model of the intent and
    behaviors of other agents. In this work, we introduce an active policy inference algorithm that allows a
    controllable agent to infer a policy of the environmental agent through interaction. Active policy inference is
    data-efficient and is particularly useful when data are time-consuming or costly to obtain. The controllable agent
    synthesizes an exploration-exploitation policy that incorporates the knowledge learned about the environment's
    behavior. Whenever possible, the agent also tries to elicit behavior from the other agent to improve the accuracy of
    the environmental model.  This is done by mapping the uncertainty in the environmental model to a bonus reward,
    which helps elicit the most informative exploration, and allows the controllable agent to return to its main task as
    fast as possible.  Experiments demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of active learning and the convergence of
    the policy for the controllable agents.
\end{abstract}

% From here on, we need Roman page numbers according to the library
% regulations. So let's assign those.

\pagenumbering{roman} % or {Roman} if you like them capitalized

% The next thing is the Preface (``Acknowledgements'').
% No standard environment for that, so we'll format it by hand.
%
\begin{center}
        \textbf{Acknowledgements}
\end{center}

	\todo[inline]{Update!}
    Original template text: I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor who made sure the thesis has at least 120
    pages, 200 pictures and lots of formulae and thus made me master \LaTeX{} like my native language.

    My thanks are also due to my reader... who has read the thesis in the two days that I gave him since it wasn't done
    until two days before due date.

    Thanks also to ... lots of friends, the fact that a week has seven days instead of only five as I had always
    thought, and the fact that I own a key to the building so I can work at four in the morning whenever I feel like it.
    That is, all the time.

% P.S. You don't have to add me to the acknowledgements for providing
% this file :)

% Now comes the Table of Contents, really easy in LaTeX. you never
% have to worried about it. (Think of all the hours you would
% have wasted in Word getting this thing updated without crashing
% the system) :).

\tableofcontents

% THAT'S IT. REALLY. Everything else is automatic. No formatting, no headline.
% All predefined.

% Now - just as easy - the List of Figures.
% This will catch all objects enclosed in \begin{figure}\end{figure}
% statements.
\listoffigures

% There is also a list of tables, if you have any.
% This will catch all objects enclosed in \begin{table}\end{table}
% statements.
\listoftables



% And we need a clear separation between preface and text, otherwise
% the numbering gets confused.

\clearpage

% And now - tataa - the text.
% This is the place to become really creative.

% From here on, we need arabic numbering again and we need to start
% from 1.

\pagenumbering{arabic}
\setcounter{page}{1}

% Break the report into external files using one for each chapter. Each chapter file should start with the `\chapter{}`
% command. Note that the chapter command starts a new page, as does the `\include{}` command.
\graphicspath{{ch1_images/} {ch2_images/} {ch3_images/} {ch4_images/} {appendix_images/}}

\include{chapter_1}
\include{chapter_2}
\include{chapter_3}
\include{chapter_4}

% Now come appendices, if you had any.
% Appendices are automatically numbered, just like everything else in
% LaTeX. But only after you gave this command
\appendix
\include{appendicies}

%\listoftodos
% Last and least (at least, that's what the library says) - the
% Bibliography.


% you can save some space by having the bibliography singlespaced, if you want
\singlespacing

%
% You should become familiar with the BibTeX program, which
% uses a *.bib-file to collect all citations that you have. It's a lot
% prettier than typing all the citations right into the document. The
% reference to citations also works well that way, but the exact
% explanation of that will be on the CS-GSO homepage, whenever I'll ever
% have time for that.
%
%
% If you use BibTeX, the bibliography is very easy. You refer to
% citations in the text with \cite{tag}, where tag is the tag that you
% defined in the bib-file.
% Then, you run bibtex once in a while during compilation, and the
% rest is done in two lines:


\bibliographystyle{alpha}
\bibliography{refs}

% which assumes a file foo.bib in your working directory.
% The word ``Bibliography'' will appear in your document as soon as
% you used ``bibtex'' on the command line.
%
% For reference on this, refer to the CS-GSO homepage.

%That's all, folks. Have fun.
