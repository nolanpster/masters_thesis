        This is mostly a presentation of results from an implementation of \cite{toussaint2010expectation}.

        If the hidden parameter, $\pi_2$ was known, then the discout optimal policy to fulfill the robots task,
        \optimal{\pi_1} could be completely solved \cite{hernandez2012adaptive}:
